Question:
  q1:
    title:      What shall I do tonight with my girlfriend?

      We shall meet in front of the Dunkin'Donuts before dinner,
      and I haven't the slightest idea of what I can do with her. 
      She's not interested in programming, space opera movies nor insects.
      She's kinda cute, so I really need to find something
      that will keep her to my side for another evening. 

  q2:
    title:      What can I offer to my step mother?

      My stepmother has everything a stepmother is usually offered
      (watch, vacuum cleaner, earrings, del.icio.us account).
      Her birthday comes next week, I am broke, and I know that
      if I don't offer her something sweet, my girlfriend
      won't look at me in the eyes for another month. 

  q3:
    title:      How can I generate traffic to my blog?

      I have a very swell blog that talks
      about my class and metas and pets and favorite movies.
